/**
 * Shared Open Graph / Twitter defaults.
 *
 * Next merges metadata *shallowly*: a page that exports its own `openGraph`
 * replaces the parent's object wholesale rather than merging into it. So a
 * default set on the root layout does not cascade, and every page has to
 * spread these in explicitly — otherwise its share preview has no card image.
 *
 * Spread these first so a page can still override a field afterwards; the
 * solution page supplies its own hero image that way.
 *
 * The image itself is app/opengraph-image.png (1200×630). Deliberately not
 * `as const` — Next's OpenGraph types require mutable arrays.
