 * The technical claims here were verified against the built site:
 *   · no cookies are set on any route
 *   · no third-party requests (fonts are self-hosted by next/font)
 *   · no analytics, tag manager, or tracking pixel
 *   · every form composes a mailto: — nothing is posted to or stored by a server
 * If any of that changes, this file must change with it.
