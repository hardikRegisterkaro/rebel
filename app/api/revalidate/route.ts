/**
 * Cache-invalidation webhook called by the CMS after a publish.
 *
 * The careers pages fetch with `force-cache` and a 5-minute revalidate window,
 * so without this an editor's change would not appear on the live site for up
 * to five minutes. This drops the affected entries immediately; the TTL stays
 * as the backstop for a missed call.
 *
 * Tag names are the CMS's — `career-list`, `career-<slug>`, `careers-page` —
 * and must stay in step with careerTags() in the CMS and the tags passed to
 * fetch() in lib/careers-api.ts. A rename on one side silently stops
 * invalidating, which looks like "publishing is broken".
